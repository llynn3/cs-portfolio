In these projects, I worked on building and analyzing different data structures and algorithms. The main problem I solved was creating a program that organizes and displays computer-science courses efficiently. Understanding runtime and memory helped me decide which data structure was best for sorting and searching — in this case, the Binary Search Tree gave a good balance of speed and simplicity.

When I ran into issues, especially with code setup and file handling, I used debugging, print statements, and research to fix them. I also practiced patience and broke the tasks into smaller steps until everything worked.

These projects really helped me understand how data structures impact performance and readability. I’ve started writing programs that are cleaner, easier to read, and more flexible if I need to update them later. It made me realize that maintainable code is just as important as working code.
